Dynamic DNS for WebFaction
==========================

Just a little Python script that updates DNS records on WebFaction.

USAGE
=====

To use this all you need to do is 2 things:
	
	1. Create a config file

		The config file is simple.
		There is an example file, 'ddns.config'.
		However in short, all comments start with a '#',
		comments and blank lines are not counted, the
		first line is your user account, and the following lines
		are the domains you wish to change.

		To avoid saving passwords in plain text,
		they are not stored in the config file.
		You shall be prompted to enter it at first run
		then it is saved your systems keyring using Python's
		'keyring' module.

	2. Run the script

		As simple as:
			'python ddns.py'

		If the config file is in the script's directory
		and named 'ddns.config'.

		Otherwise Just:
			'python ddns.py [config_file]'
